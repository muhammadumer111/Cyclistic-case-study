# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study 
 Presented by: Muhammad Umer

## Project Overview
This case study analyzes the **last 12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data** to understand the differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**.  
The goal is to provide **data-driven recommendations** to increase annual memberships and support long-term, sustainable growth.

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available here: [Cyclistic Bike Share Dataset]([https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html])  
➡ For this project, only the **most recent 12 months of data** were used.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Power Query for data cleaning, preparation & visualization)  
- Microsoft PowerPoint (for presentation)

## Key Insights
- **Seasonality:** Casual riders peak in summer (June–August); members ride more consistently year-round.  
- **Usage patterns:** Members ride mainly on weekdays (commuting); casual riders ride more on weekends (leisure/tourism).  
- **Trip duration:** Most trips are under 30 minutes; casual riders take slightly longer trips.  

## Recommendations
1. **Seasonal conversion campaigns** targeting summer casuals with upgrade offers.  
2. **Commuter value messaging** emphasizing savings and convenience for weekday riders.  
3. **Trial/weekend memberships** to let casual riders experience membership benefits.
